# Beacon (WDI Project-3 Group)

## Synopsis & Inspiration

For our project we decided to tackle building a product from a General Assembly UX Design Immersive (UXDI) students final project named Beacon. Their summary of Beacon is:
> Allows Lonely Planet users to connect with other travelers in the same region, so they can either meet up or read and share suggestions about off-the-beaten-path adventures and real-time events not found in guidebooks.

Our goal was to build a web app based on the specs of this project.

You can view the original project [here](http://res.cloudinary.com/general-assembly-profiles/image/upload/v1431701133/bjstiabt0gisj9dnxd9y.pdf).

## Learning Objectives

- An API of your own design, built using Express & Mongoose, which serves JSON.
- Front-end JS code that updates the UI, and makes requests to the API using AJAX.
- Working collaboratively

## User Stories
This is a list of all user stories and what we determined to be included in our MVP.

MVP = *

As a User :
* * sign-up using Facebook | user creation is easy
* * create a profile w/ current location & interests | other uses can see it and customize profile pic
* add points of interests (maybe to map) |
* * search other user by interest and/or location | find potential travel companions
* * contact other users by email | we can decide to meet
* * view other user profile | we can decide to meet
* add travel history | track my travels / other users can see it
* simple blog/travel log | share my experiences / participate in community
* upload travel photos
* customize my profile
* review other users

## Technologies Used

* JQuery
* Mongodb
* Mongoose
* Passportjs
* Expressjs
* Nodejs
* Bootstrap
* Heroku
* Git

## Future Development

These are features we would like to update at a later time:

- Messaging
- On-boarding process
- Adding Geo-location (lat, lon) - ability to filter users by distance
- Filter by interests
- Push states
