# Beacon (WDI Project-3 Group)

## Synopsis

For our project we decided to tackle building a product from a General Assembly UX Design Immersive (UXDI) students final project named Beacon. Their summary of Beacon is:
> Allows Lonely Planet users to connect with other travelers in the same region, so they can either meet up or read and share suggestions about off-the-beaten-path adventures and real-time events not found in guidebooks.

Our goal was to build a web app based on the specs of this project.

## User Stories
This is a list of all user stories and what we determined to be included in our MVP.

* = MVP

As a User :
* - sign-up using Facebook | user creation is easy
* - create a profile w/ current location & interests | other uses can see it and customize profile pic
* add points of interests (maybe to map) |
* * search other user by interest and/or location | find potential travel companions
* * contact other users by email | we can decide to meet
* - view other user profile | we can decide to meet
* add travel history | track my travels / other users can see it
* simple blog/travel log | share my experiences / participate in community
* upload travel photos
* customize my profile
* review other users

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
